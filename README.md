# MyMC Enhancement Suite (MyMCES)

MyMCES is a [user script](https://github.com/OpenUserJs/OpenUserJS.org/wiki/Userscript-beginners-HOWTO) that adds a number of improvements and optimizations to the Montgomery College student portal (MyMC).

## Features
### Implemented
* **Co-Req Highlighter** - In the Course Search tool when a course is selected that course's required co-requisites will be highligted, making them easier to spot.

### Planned
* [Rate My Professor](http://ratemyprofessor.com) integration for fetching rating and hotness information for MC professors if available

## Installation
To use this script you will need a userscript plugin for your browser. For Chrome the most popular extension is [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), for Firefox it's [Greasemonkey](https://github.com/OpenUserJs/OpenUserJS.org/wiki/Greasemonkey-for-Firefox), and for Opera it's also [Tampermonkey](https://github.com/OpenUserJs/OpenUserJS.org/wiki/Tampermonkey-for-Opera). Sorry Internet Explorer/Edge users, your browser is too dated to support this awesome technology :sob:

(more details to come here while I figure out the rest of the installation process)
